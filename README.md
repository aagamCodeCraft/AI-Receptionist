## üìñ Application Flow

The demo above showcases the primary user journey through the application:

1.  **Language Selection:** The application starts by offering a choice between **English** and **Hindi**. This choice dictates the language for the entire user interface.
2.  **Welcome Screen:** The main hub for navigation. From here, a user can choose to book a new appointment, handle an emergency, select a lab test, or check in for an existing appointment.
3.  **Back Navigation:** A back arrow on the Welcome Screen allows the user to return to the language selection screen at any time without restarting the application.
4.  **Specialty Selection:** When booking an appointment, the user first chooses a medical specialty (e.g., Cardiology, Orthopedics).
5.  **Doctor Selection:** The application displays a list of available doctors for the chosen specialty, showing their name, qualifications, availability status, and consultation fees in the selected language.
6.  **Appointment Booking:** The user selects a doctor and proceeds to a booking form to enter their name, phone, age, and gender.
7.  **Live Photo Capture:** Using **OpenCV**, the application activates the system's webcam, allowing the user to capture a live photo for their patient profile.
8.  **Booking Confirmation:** After filling out the form and capturing a photo, the user confirms the booking and payment, completing the appointment process.
